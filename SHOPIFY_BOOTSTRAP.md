# Shopify Project Bootstrap

A reusable setup runbook for starting a new Shopify + Claude Code project. Drop this file into any new project directory and say:

> "Follow the instructions outlined in the .md file at `<path-to-this-file>`"

Claude Code will run through environment setup, connect to the store, and lay down the standing project files — the same steps used to bootstrap this project.

---

## Step 1 — Environment check

Run these checks and report results before doing anything else:

```bash
claude mcp list
claude plugin list
node --version
npm --version
shopify version
```

Confirm: is `shopify-ai-toolkit` in the installed plugins list? Is Node/npm present? Is Shopify CLI present?

## Step 2 — Install the Shopify AI Toolkit plugin

This is Shopify's official Claude Code plugin (launched April 2026) — bundles doc search, GraphQL/Liquid validation, and CLI-based store execution skills (products, orders, discounts, pages, themes). It supersedes any need for a manually-created custom app / hand-copied Admin API token for most store operations.

```bash
claude plugin install shopify-ai-toolkit
```

If already installed, skip.

## Step 3 — Install Shopify CLI

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
shopify version
```

## Step 4 — Authenticate

Ask the user to run this themselves (it opens a browser OAuth flow tied to their personal Shopify account — do not attempt to script around it):

```bash
shopify auth login
```

Wait for them to confirm success before continuing.

## Step 5 — Get the store domain and verify connection

Ask the user for their store's domain (`something.myshopify.com`, findable in Shopify Admin under Settings → Domains, or in the browser URL when logged into `/admin`).

Then verify the connection (read-only, safe to run without asking):

```bash
shopify store info --store <store-domain>.myshopify.com --json
```

Report back the store name, plan, and owner so the user can confirm it's the right store.

## Step 6 — Store-scoped API access (no custom app needed)

For product/discount/order/theme operations, use the CLI's built-in store execution flow instead of a manually-created custom app:

```bash
shopify store auth --store <store-domain>.myshopify.com --scopes <needed-scopes>
shopify store execute --store <store-domain>.myshopify.com --query '...' [--allow-mutations]
```

- `shopify store auth` triggers a one-time browser consent click per new scope set — this is Shopify's own security gate and cannot (and should not) be scripted around.
- Read-only operations: omit `--allow-mutations`.
- Mutations (create/update/delete): include `--allow-mutations`.
- Sales/analytics questions: use ShopifyQL via the `shopifyqlQuery` Admin GraphQL field, scope `read_reports`.

## Step 7 — Create the standing project files

Create `CLAUDE.md` in the project root with these always-do rules (adjust the "Session objectives" section per project):

```markdown
# <Store/Project Name> — Shopify Store Project Conventions

## Always-do rules (safety)

1. **Always /plan first.** For any task that mutates store data (products, discounts, theme files, pages, navigation, etc.), outline the plan before executing.
2. **Never edit the Live theme directly.** All theme/code changes happen in a duplicated draft theme.
3. **New products, discounts, and pages default to Draft/Hidden.** Nothing goes live-facing without explicit user go-ahead to publish.
4. **Confirm before irreversible or customer-visible actions**: publishing a theme, activating a discount, publishing a product, sending customer-facing emails, deleting anything.
5. **Log every mutation** in PROGRESS.md — what was called, when, and the result.

## Store access

- Connection method: `shopify-ai-toolkit` plugin + Shopify CLI (`shopify store auth` / `shopify store execute`)
- Store domain: <fill in>
- Primary theme in use: <fill in>

## Session objectives (current)

<fill in per project>
```

Create `PROGRESS.md` in the project root as an audit log:

```markdown
# PROGRESS LOG

Audit log of every API call and file change made to the store or this project. Newest entries at the top.

---

## <date>

- <setup steps performed>
```

## Step 8 — Confirm and hand off

Summarize what's connected (store name, plan, owner) and ask the user what they want to work on first. Do not start mutating store data — creating products, discounts, pages, or theme changes — until they've told you the actual task; this file only covers environment setup.

## Notes for future updates to this file

- If Shopify changes the plugin name, CLI command surface, or the store-execution flow, update this file rather than relying on trained knowledge — the tooling around AI agents on Shopify is new and moves fast (this file was last validated 2026-08-07 against `shopify-ai-toolkit` v1.6.1 / Shopify CLI v4.6.0; re-checked 2026-08-23 on a different machine with `shopify-ai-toolkit` v1.7.0 / Shopify CLI v4.7.0, no command-surface changes observed).
- **`shopify auth login` cannot run non-interactively.** Running it from Claude Code's own Bash/PowerShell tool (even with `--alias`) fails with `Failed to prompt: Which account would you like to use?` — there's no TTY for the account picker. Step 4 already says to ask the user to run it themselves; this is confirmed, not just a precaution — don't try to script around it even if explicitly told you're "allowed" to run auth commands, since it will just fail. Wait for the user to confirm they've run it in their own terminal before continuing to Step 5.
